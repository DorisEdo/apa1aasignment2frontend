ðŸŒ¿ Supabase Natural Hair Recipe App â€“ Frontend
Project Overview
This is the frontend for a CRUD-based Natural Hair Recipe App. Users can add, view, update, and delete DIY natural hair care recipes such as masks, cleansers, and moisturizers.

The app is connected to a Supabase backend via RESTful edge functions and showcases real-time, user-driven interaction with recipe data. Users can filter recipes by category and preview image URLs.
